  <h1>What if capybaras replaced humans?</h1>

  <p>Capybaras are known for their intelligence, social skills, and adaptability, 
    which are qualities that humans value highly. In addition, capybaras are herbivores 
    and do not have the same negative impact on the environment as humans do. <br>
    If capybaras were to become the dominant species, it is possible that they would 
    create a more sustainable and harmonious world. They may prioritize conservation 
    efforts and focus on maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Capybaras are also known for 
    their peaceful nature and ability to live cooperatively in large groups, which could 
    lead to a more peaceful and equitable society.</p>
